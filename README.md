# odin-recipes

This project is about making a recipe book using just HTML.
I have added 3 recipes to the site, and each recipe page contains the name of the recipe, an image, a short description, ingredients and the steps to make the recipe.
Recipe credits goes to allrecipes.com

Some style declarations were added using CSS after completing "The Cascade" lesson in The-Odin-Project.
